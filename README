--- Resistance ---

Info:
"The Resistance is a party game modeling a battle between a resistance group and the spies infiltrating it. It is similar in structure to party games such as Mafia or Werewolf, where a small, secret group of informed players (the "Imperial Spies") attempt to destroy a larger group they're infiltrating (the "Resistance Movement"), while the larger group attempts to ferret out the spies and eliminate them. The Resistance uses slightly different mechanics from similar games, designed to avoid player elimination and increase available information for player decisions. The game is playable with an ordinary deck of cards, and the complete rules have been made freely available online."
